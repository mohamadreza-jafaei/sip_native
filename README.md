# sip_native

A native SIP flutter plugin

## Motivation
Currently our team is working on solution that requires and uses sip but available sip packages only support websocket as a connection protocol and after struggles using it we were disappointed, so we decided to build one from scratch using [link here ](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/connectivity/sip)

## Disclaimer
1. #### Android Supported Only
  Currently only android is supported even though flutter is fully cross platform
  
2. #### Support
  Even though the specs states the SIP API is available for Android devices from 2.3, it is not. The Android SIP API is not supported on all devices. Interestingly,   it is supported on my old 2.3 LG P970 and not my 4.4 Moto G. (By the way, you have to test on real device and not the Android emulator).
  Now there are alternatives:
  With the Android SIP API out, what are the alternatives? Well, there are a couple of open source SIP stacks for Android. The popular ones people talk about are:

- JAIN
- MjSIP
- PjSIP
- Doubango

## Getting Started
1. #### Install this plugin
Currently the plugin is not available in [pub.dev](https://pub.dev) In your pubspec.yaml add the following
```
  sip_native:
      git:
        url: https://github.com/iampato/sip_native.git

```
2. #### SipNative plugin supported
   Check if the plugin is supported by the device
```
    void main() {
      WidgetsFlutterBinding.ensureInitialized();
      SipNative.initPlugin().then((SipNativeSupport value) {
        Fluttertoast.showToast(
          msg: "Voip supported: ${value.isVoipSupported}\n" +
              "SipManager supported: ${value.isSipManagerSupported}",
          backgroundColor: value.isVoipSupported ? Colors.green : Colors.red,
          toastLength: Toast.LENGTH_LONG,
        );
      });
      runApp(MyApp());
    }
   
```

2. #### Sip connect
You can further specify other parameters i.e
1. Protocol -> support protocols are UDP,TLS,TCP
2. Port -> By default the port is 5060
```
  bool response = await SipNative.initSipConnection(
    username: "test_username",
    password: "test_password",
    domain: "sip.linphone.org",
  );
```


3. #### Sip connection status listener
The stream emits Strings, and the following are events emited
  1. `UNKNOWN` -> we do not know anything (it's the initial)
  2. `ONREGISTERING` -> attempting to connect
  3. `ONREGISTRATIONDONE` -> connected all is well
  4. `ONREGISTRATIONFAILED` -> an error occurred and you should wrap this function in a try catch to catch the exception plus the reason for the failure
```
  try {
    SipNative.registrationStateStream().listen((event) {
      setState(() {
        _registrationState = event.toString();
      });
    });
  } catch (e) {
    print(e.toString());  
  }
```
4. #### Sip init audio call
A future that returns void and takes two parameters 
  1. Username

since in the background the plugin generates a profile uri:
example username: test_user and domain: test_domain will be 
`test_user@test_domain` the domain will be gotten from sip manager
```
 await SipNative.initCall("test_user");
```
5. #### Sip call state status listener
```
The stream emits Strings, and the following are events emited
  1. `UNKNOWN` -> we do not know anything (it's the initial)
  2. ONCALLING,
  3. ONRINGING,
  4. ONRINGINGBACK,
  5. ONREADYTOCALL,
  6. ONCALLESTABLISHED,
  7. ONCALLENDED,
  8. ONCALLBUSY,
  9. ONERROR,
```
```
  try {
    SipNative.callsStateStream().listen((event) {
      setState(() {
        _registrationState = event.toString();
      });
    });
  } catch (e) {
    print(e.toString());  
  }

```
6. #### Sip hold call
```
await SipNative.holdCall();
```
7. #### Sip mute call
```
await SipNative.muteCall();
```
8. #### Sip speaker mode
```
await SipNative.changeSpeakerMode();
```
9. #### Sip end call
```
await SipNative.endCall();
```
10. #### Sip disconnect
```
await SipNative.disconnectSip();
```

This project is a starting point for a Flutter
[plug-in package](https://flutter.dev/developing-packages/),
a specialized package that includes platform-specific implementation code for
Android and/or iOS.

For help getting started with Flutter, view our
[online documentation](https://flutter.dev/docs), which offers tutorials,
samples, guidance on mobile development, and a full API reference.


## Advice

Always call `SipNative.disconnectSip()` while closing the app to clear any sip session created
